# Pacman

This is a Pac-Man clone that I wrote in C(99) for Windows. This is a from-scratch approach and doesn't make use of any game engines or frameworks. Therefore there are no external dependencies outside of the stuff that ships with Windows itself.

The renderer is done in software and OpenGL is used to draw a single-textured quad to the screen.
